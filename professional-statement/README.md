# Professional Statement

Hi! I'm Gabriela, an aspiring cybersecurity professional currently earning my Associate's Degree in Computer Science. I’m passionate about technology and problem-solving, with hands-on experience running queries, conducting audits, and managing system access for HR staff.

While I don’t have direct cybersecurity experience yet, I’m eager to enter the field and take on an entry-level role that challenges me, helps me grow, and deepens my technical skillset. I’m especially drawn to access management, incident response, and security compliance.

This statement is the foundation of my cybersecurity journey, and this GitHub portfolio reflects the skills I’m building along the way.
